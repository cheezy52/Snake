Snake
========

This is a browser-based implementation of the game "Snake".  Navigate around the Snake Pit, eating apples to grow as they appear before you, but be careful not to run into the walls or your own body, lest your insatiable hunger lead to your doom!

High scores are tracked within a single play session, but are not persisted across reloads.

To play, open "index.html" in your browser of choice.

Controls
========
Use the arrow keys to turn the snake.  Controls are relative to the overall playfield, not the snake's current direction of motion.
